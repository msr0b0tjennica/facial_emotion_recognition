Facial Emotion Recognition with Deep Learning
This project implements a Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) system using deep learning techniques in Python. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify human emotions from facial expressions captured in images.

üîç Overview
Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a computer vision task that aims to detect and classify human emotions from facial images. This project uses a CNN model trained on the FER-2013 dataset to classify images into one of the following emotion categories:

Angry

Disgust

Fear

Happy

Sad

Surprise

Neutral
